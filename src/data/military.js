  defenseRating: "A number representing your total military strength. Combines garrison soldiers, castle fortifications, morale, and special bonuses. Higher is better.",
  upkeep: "The ongoing cost to maintain your military each season. Soldiers need food, wages, and equipment. If you can't pay upkeep, morale drops.",
  levy: "Ordinary villagers called to serve in defense. The word 'fyrd' is Anglo-Saxon for 'army of the people.' Cheap but not well-trained.",
  menAtArms: "Professional soldiers who fight for a living. Better equipped and trained than levy peasants, but more expensive.",
  knight: "A heavily armored mounted warrior. The elite of medieval warfare. A single knight could defeat many ordinary soldiers \u2014 but the cost of armor, horse, and squire was enormous.",
  palisade: "A fence of sharpened wooden stakes driven into the ground. The simplest castle defense. Quick to build but vulnerable to fire.",
  curtainWall: "The main outer wall of a castle, usually built of stone. 'Curtain' because it hangs between towers like a curtain between posts.",
  portcullis: "A heavy iron or wooden grid that slides vertically in grooves to block a gateway. From the French 'porte coulissante' \u2014 sliding door.",
  murderHoles: "Openings in the ceiling of a gatehouse passage through which defenders dropped stones, boiling water, or hot sand on attackers below.",
  concentric: "Having two or more rings of walls, one inside the other. If attackers breach the outer wall, they're trapped between the two walls.",
  moat: "A deep trench, often filled with water, surrounding a castle. Prevents direct assault on walls and makes tunneling extremely difficult.",
  barbican: "A fortified extension of a gatehouse, projecting outward from the castle. Forces attackers through a narrow, heavily defended corridor.",
  motteAndBailey: "The earliest Norman castle design: a raised mound of earth (motte) topped by a wooden tower, surrounded by an enclosed yard (bailey).",
  morale: "The spirit and willingness of soldiers to fight. High morale means they'll hold under pressure. Low morale means they'll run \u2014 or worse.",
  recruitCost: "The one-time price to hire a new soldier. Covers equipment, initial training, and a signing bonus.",

// ─── Scribe's Notes (educational flavor text) ─────────────────────

export const MILITARY_SCRIBES_NOTES = {
  feudalObligation: "In the feudal system, every lord owed military service to his overlord \u2014 and every peasant owed service to his lord. The 'fyrd' (Anglo-Saxon) or 'levy' (Norman) system required free men to serve in defense of their community for a set number of days per year, usually 40. They brought their own weapons \u2014 often just a farming tool or a sharpened stick. Professional soldiers (men-at-arms) were far more effective but had to be paid, housed, and equipped year-round. Knights \u2014 the medieval equivalent of tanks \u2014 were devastatingly powerful but ruinously expensive. A lord's challenge was always the same: how much defense can I afford without bankrupting my estate? This tension between security and solvency defined medieval governance.",
  castleEvolution: "Castle design evolved over centuries in direct response to new attack methods. The first castles were simple mounds of earth (mottes) with wooden fences (baileys) \u2014 built fast but vulnerable to fire. Stone replaced wood, creating the iconic medieval fortress. When attackers learned to tunnel under walls, moats were dug. When battering rams broke gates, portcullises were added. When siege towers scaled walls, flanking towers provided crossfire. Edward I's concentric castles at Caernarfon, Conwy, and Harlech represent the pinnacle of medieval military engineering \u2014 and cost as much as a modern aircraft carrier relative to the national budget. Defense was the most expensive thing a medieval lord could buy.",
  militaryMorale: "Medieval armies were held together by loyalty, pay, and fear \u2014 in roughly that order. Soldiers who weren't paid deserted. Soldiers who lost faith in their commander surrendered. The most effective military leaders \u2014 Richard the Lionheart, William Marshal, Henry V \u2014 understood that morale was as important as steel. Henry V's speech at Agincourt (immortalized by Shakespeare) turned an exhausted, outnumbered army into a fighting force that destroyed the French cavalry. Words, food, and coin: the three weapons of morale.",
