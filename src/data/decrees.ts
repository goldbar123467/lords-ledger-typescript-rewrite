      "Bridge tolls, called 'pontage,' were a major source of revenue " +
      "for medieval lords. Control of a river crossing gave enormous " +
      "economic leverage. However, the Church frequently objected to " +
      "tolls charged to pilgrims, and excessive tolls could drive trade " +
      "to rival routes. Balancing revenue against goodwill was a " +
      "constant challenge.",
