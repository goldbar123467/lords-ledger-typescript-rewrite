  "You think your treasury is impressive? Mansa Musa of Mali carried so much gold on his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 that when he passed through Cairo, he gave away so much of it that he crashed Egypt's gold market FOR TWELVE YEARS. The man was so generous he broke an entire country's economy by accident.",
  "You drink coffee, yes? Thank a goat. An Ethiopian herder named Kaldi noticed his goats dancing \u2014 DANCING \u2014 after eating certain berries. Monks in Yemen brewed them into a drink to stay awake during prayers. By the 1400s, coffeehouses in Cairo and Istanbul were everywhere. Europeans didn't figure out coffee for another two hundred years. You're welcome.",
  "In 859 AD \u2014 that's almost 1,200 years ago \u2014 a woman named Fatima al-Fihri used her inheritance to build the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco. It's still open TODAY. Oxford didn't exist for another 237 years. Harvard? Don't make me laugh. That's 777 years later.",
  "While European doctors were saying 'have you tried leeches?' the physician al-Zahrawi in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain was writing a 1,500-page medical encyclopedia with ILLUSTRATIONS of surgical instruments. He invented tools for removing cataracts from people's EYES. With a needle. On purpose. And it worked.",
  "In 1154, a Muslim geographer named al-Idrisi made a map for the King of Sicily that was more accurate than anything in Europe. Only one problem for you lot \u2014 south was at the TOP. Africa was on top, Europe was on the bottom. He wasn't wrong, by the way. There IS no real 'up' on a sphere. Think about that tonight.",
  "The Mongol Empire ran a postal system called the Yam. Horse relay stations every 25 miles across ALL of Central Asia. A message could travel from Beijing to Budapest in DAYS. Genghis Khan didn't conquer the world with just swords \u2014 he conquered it with really, really fast mail. Your Amazon package still takes a week.",
  "In the Kingdom of Ghana, salt was so valuable that traders would exchange it POUND FOR POUND with gold. Think about that. The same stuff you dump on french fries was worth its weight in treasure. Merchants from the Sahara carried salt blocks on camel caravans for MONTHS to trade in Timbuktu. Some salt blocks were used as money. You could literally lick your wallet.",
  "In the 900s, Baghdad had an entire street called the Suq al-Warraqin \u2014 the Stationers' Market \u2014 with over a HUNDRED shops selling nothing but handwritten books. They had poetry, science, philosophy, fiction. Meanwhile, some European monasteries owned maybe twelve books total and chained them to the shelves so nobody would steal them. Chained. Books.",
  "Zheng He was a Chinese Muslim admiral who commanded a fleet of 300 ships \u2014 some of them 400 feet long. Columbus had three ships. Three. And they were about 60 feet. Zheng He sailed to India, Arabia, and East Africa between 1405 and 1433. He brought back giraffes. GIRAFFES. The Chinese emperor was very confused.",
  "Hospitals in the Islamic world \u2014 called bimaristans \u2014 were free to everyone, regardless of religion or wealth. The one in Cairo had separate wards for different diseases, a pharmacy, and \u2014 I am not making this up \u2014 musicians who played soothing music to help patients heal. Your doctor's office has a four-month-old magazine. Think about that.",
  "You think Vikings only raided? They were businessmen! Arab silver coins called dirhams have been found in Viking graves in Sweden. The traveler Ibn Fadlan actually met the Vikings on the Volga River and wrote about them. He said they were the tallest people he'd ever seen and also... the least hygienic. He was very specific about that. Very. Specific.",
  "When people say 'from here to Timbuktu,' they mean 'the middle of nowhere.' But in the 1400s, Timbuktu \u2014 in present-day Mali \u2014 was one of the most important intellectual cities on EARTH. The Sankore Madrasah had 25,000 students. They studied astronomy, law, medicine, and mathematics. More students than most American colleges today. Nowhere? Please.",
  "In 807 AD, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid sent Charlemagne \u2014 the King of the Franks \u2014 a water clock. It had twelve mechanical knights that popped out on the hour. Charlemagne's people thought it was MAGIC. They literally couldn't figure out how it worked. Meanwhile in Baghdad, it was just a nice gift. A regifting, probably.",
  "Chess was invented in India, picked up by Persian scholars, then carried across the Islamic world by traders and travelers. The pieces got Arabic names \u2014 'checkmate' comes from 'shah mat,' which means 'the king is helpless.' Europeans learned the game from Muslims in Spain. So every time you play chess, you're playing a 1,400-year-old import.",
  "The Alhambra in Granada, Spain, built by the Moors, has rooms where the architecture is designed so that a whisper in one corner can be heard perfectly in the opposite corner \u2014 across the entire room. They also carved 'There is no conqueror but God' into the walls over 9,000 times. Nine. Thousand. That's not decoration. That's dedication.",

  "Medieval soldiers were not the gleaming knights of legend. Most were ordinary men \u2014 farmers, tradesmen, younger sons \u2014 pressed into service by feudal obligation or drawn by the promise of pay and plunder. A typical soldier\u2019s life was monotony punctuated by terror: months of marching, digging, and waiting, then minutes of chaos. Those who survived carried the experience for the rest of their lives. Veterans like Aldric were repositories of hard-won knowledge in an age before military academies.";
