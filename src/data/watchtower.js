  "A castle isn\u2019t a building. It\u2019s a system. Walls slow attackers. Towers provide crossfire. The keep is the last stand. Every element works together. One weakness \u2014 a rotting gate, an unguarded postern \u2014 and the whole system fails.",
  "The garrison eats whether we fight or not. That\u2019s the true cost of defense \u2014 not the swords and armor, but the daily bread. Every soldier on the wall is one less farmer in the field. Defense is an economic choice.",
  "Edward I built a ring of castles across Wales \u2014 Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, Beaumaris. Concentric design: walls within walls. An attacker who breached the outer wall found themselves trapped in a killing ground between the first and second walls. Brilliant. Expensive. Effective.",
  "The crossbow changed everything. A peasant with two weeks of training could kill a knight who\u2019d spent a lifetime mastering the sword. The Church tried to ban crossbows against Christians \u2014 they succeeded only in making sure everyone used them.",
  "At Stirling Bridge, William Wallace used terrain to defeat a larger English force. The bridge was narrow \u2014 only two horsemen abreast. The Scots waited until half the English army had crossed, then attacked. Geography is a weapon.",
  "A siege is not a battle. It\u2019s a logistics problem. The attacker must feed an army in the field. The defender must outlast them. Whichever side runs out of food first loses. This is why your grain stores matter more than your swordsmen.",
  "Mercenaries \u2014 \u2018free companies\u2019 \u2014 roamed medieval Europe selling their swords to the highest bidder. After the Hundred Years\u2019 War, thousands of unemployed soldiers turned bandit. The line between soldier and criminal was often just a matter of who was paying.",
  "The motte-and-bailey was the medieval world\u2019s prefab fortress. Normans could raise one in two weeks: pile earth into a mound, build a wooden tower on top, surround the base with a palisade. Quick, cheap, and surprisingly effective. Your estate probably started as one.",
  "Night raids were feared above all. Attackers would scale walls in darkness, open the gate from inside, and the garrison would wake to enemies already among them. This is why castle gates had multiple barriers \u2014 portcullis, murder holes, a drawbridge \u2014 any one of which could stop a night assault.",
  "The Scots raided English borderlands for centuries. They called it \u2018reiving\u2019 \u2014 taking livestock, burning crops, kidnapping for ransom. English lords built \u2018peel towers\u2019 \u2014 small fortified towers where a family could shelter during a raid. Your watchtower serves the same purpose. Some things never change.",

Chains of beacon fires could relay warnings across entire kingdoms: when the Spanish Armada was spotted in 1588, a chain of beacons carried the news from Plymouth to London in minutes. On a smaller scale, every manor lord relied on scouts, watchmen, and signal fires to avoid being caught by surprise. The difference between spotting raiders an hour early and being caught unaware was often the difference between survival and destruction.";
