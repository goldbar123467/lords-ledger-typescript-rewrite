Some were desperate peasants driven to crime by famine or unjust lords. Others were organized gangs who terrorized entire regions. The famous legend of Robin Hood \u2014 whether based on a real person or not \u2014 reflects a society where the line between outlaw and hero was often a matter of perspective.",

      "The Anglo-Scottish border was one of the most violent frontiers in medieval Europe. For centuries, raiding parties (known as 'reivers') crossed in both directions, stealing livestock, burning farms, and kidnapping for ransom. Border families \u2014 English and Scottish alike \u2014 built fortified tower houses called 'peel towers' for protection. The raids were so constant that a unique border culture emerged, with its own laws, its own loyalties, and its own code of honor. The word 'bereaved' comes from the border reiving tradition \u2014 to be 'reived' was to be robbed of everything.",
